PRIOR_PRODUCTION_MUTATION: ZERO

COMPLETED: Fresh governance/Git handshake; known main governance dirt reconciled without mutation; all worktrees inventoried; related local/remote branches and divergence counted; release/v0.8.3 FI00–FI17 Playground lineage selected as base; isolated reconciliation worktree created; full master prompt persisted; two-branch policy and deterministic validators updated; P01 manifest written.

VALIDATION: Prompt fidelity differs from the attachment only by the accepted status field; Prettier passed on formatter-owned changed files; focused Vitest passed 3 files and 13 tests; agent instruction, continuation, handoff, and diff checks passed.

PRESERVED: main working state; backend and v0.8.4 worktrees; frontend-design-integration `.ai-bridge/` and `.local/`; all recovery/design/release refs; prior Playground D1/R2/runtime state; canonical root AGENTS.md.

EXTERNAL_ACTIONS: Read-only `git fetch origin` and the exact P00/P01 checkpoint push to `origin/reconcile/playground-master` only. No deployment, provider, database, migration, reset, data, Google, Production, or Figma write.

DO_NOT_REPEAT: Do not recreate the reconciliation branch/worktree. Do not broad-merge frontend/design branches. Do not reset the prior generation-3 DIRTY Playground merely for a clean appearance. Verify live identity before consequential Playground action.

BLOCKER: NONE
NEXT_EXACT_ACTION: Execute P03: capture fresh live blank-root browser, console, network, asset, routing, and deployed-identity evidence before any redesign or product repair.
RESUME_COMMANDS: Read the accepted master prompt, current chain, and reconciliation manifest; run exact Git handshake; reverify live Playground identity before any external mutation.
PROHIBITED_ACTIONS: Production/main deployment or mutation; branch deletion; history rewrite; unknown residue mutation; Figma write; unbacked reset/migration; unverified R2 deletion.
HANDOFF_STATUS: ACTIVE
